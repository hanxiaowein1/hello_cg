here are some questions in mc33

1. case 6.1.2, the right face is not accurate, iso surface do not lay on face, but the triangle iso surface lay on face.

triangle cannot intersect with connected negative points
cannot connect interpolation points of two disconnected points(may be it's allowed in same face)
interpolation points in the inner of cube(maybe has some relationship of negative points and connectiveness, but if some others has already do this work, then it will be useless)


didn't read others paper, do it by your own is dangerous
